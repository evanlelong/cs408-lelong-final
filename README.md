# Final Project - CookBook

## Project Spec

What is the general theme? - The general theme of this final project is going to a be recipe cookbook. This is going to include a homepage of all the recipes and allowing filtering for certain recipes for users to be able to find recipies. Then we are also going to be able to add recipies along with that and view individual recipies.
What is it going to do? - It is going to be used by anyone trying to learn to cook. I hope to showcase easy health friendly recipies for users to be able to view. This is also going to allow people who want to share their recipies to add them and people to view. This is manily just going to be an infomrational website but also have some user functionality.
Who is the target audience? - The target audience is going to be anyone who wants to learn how to cook. This can also be people who do know how to cook to learn new recipies. Since this website will also allow users to add recipes this can be used by chefs to add their recipies for people to cook. This can help those people get exposure and have people rate their recipe.
What sort of data will it manage? - So we are going to have to create a few tables. One will be the recipe table and it will hold most of all the information I think. I will have like a name, rating, description, time, instructions. Then depending on what page the user is on will determine what data we need to show. We will also allow users to post data, by creating a new recipe.
Stretch Goals? I think some cool features I want to add is going to be like a favorites tab. This will allow users to favorite any recipe and show up so when i get on the website im able to find it easier. I also think adding a signup/login page would be nice, this way we can have users associated with the recipe they make, and that way If i make a recipe and i want to alter it, only the user who made the recipe has access to be able to update it. Then the last feature I think would be cool to add is within that login/signup a recipe post will be able to have comments. This can help FAQ with that recipe and also allow users to submit a rating of the recipe and say things that worked/didnt work for other users. 
Plan - I have a plan for this project, The first thing IM going to do is set up all my CRUD operations and make sure they are working Via postman. Then im going to get the baseline skeleton working, with all the operations and buttons working. I then hope to add CSS and make the website look visually appealing and all the pages with the same theme. Then lastly we are going to work on testing and adding new features if I have time at the very end.
